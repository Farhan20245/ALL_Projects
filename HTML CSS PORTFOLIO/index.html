          <p>Hello, I am Farhan Alam. I am currently doing a bachelorâ€™s Course in Software Engineering at Daffodil International University located at Savar Abulia. I live in Faramgate Tejkunipara Dhaka. My hometown is also Dhaka.</p>
          <p>My hobbies are Graphics Designing, where I create graphical websites, posters, logos, etc. I acquired this skill while studying at Daffodil International University. I enjoy graphics designing as I love colorful images and it gives me enjoyment doing so. Communicating through clients taught me a lot of social skills and I am grateful for that. For this, I use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I enjoy Web Designing using HTML, CSS, and JS. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but it was very rewarding. I also acquired this skill while studying at Daffodil International University.</p>
